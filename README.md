not the most glamorous personal project but it will help me in my knowledge of algorithms and data structures and the final vision is to have the user be able to pick the maze size and all that, what maze generation algorithm to use to generate the maze, and then the user can pick from different maze solving algorithms and visually see it be solved in real time. of course i will be coding these algorithms myself and learning about them instead of straight pulling from elsewhere. should be a simple looking project but develops my skills a ton!
